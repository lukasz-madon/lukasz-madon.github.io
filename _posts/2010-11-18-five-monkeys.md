<blockquote><strong>The Monkeys and the Bananas</strong></p>
<p>Five monkeys were in a room that contained  a table in one corner, and a banana hanging from a string in the middle  of the room. The monkeys figured out that if they dragged the table to  the middle of the room, they could climb up and grab the banana. So they  did. As one of the monkeys quickly hopped up and reached for the  banana, hidden compartments in the walls suddenly opened, releasing  high-pressure cold water that knocked the monkey off the table and  drenched the other four monkeys.</p>
<p>They quickly learned that whenever one of  them climbed on the table, all of them were soaked with cold water. They  realized climbing on top of the table was a bad idea. Unbeknownst to  the monkeys, the high-pressure cold water hoses were disconnected and  removed.</p>
<p>The next week, one of the five monkeys was  removed from the room and replaced by a new monkey. The new monkey saw  the table and the banana dangling from the ceiling. Realizing that the  banana was there for the taking, the monkey headed for the table. But  fearful of being drenched by the high-pressure cold water, the other  four monkeys pounced on the newcomer and beat the tar out of him. Every  time the new monkey got near the table, the others beat him up. Soon the  new monkey no longer went near the table.</p>
<p>By the third week, another of the original  five monkeys was replaced by a new monkey. And like the monkey the week  before, the newest member of the group tried to get near the table to  move it over to the banana. Once again, the others beat up the newest  member of the group. Even the first new monkey joined in.</p>
<p>Each successive week, one more of the  original monkeys was replaced. The same thing happened every time; when  the newest monkey attempted to get near the table, the others joined in  to discourage him.</p>
<p>By the sixth week, not a single monkey was  left from the original group. Not one remained that had been squirted  with cold water. But when the newest monkey headed toward the table and  tried to reach the banana, the other four monkeys “trained” him by  beating the tar out of him.</p>
<p>If you could ask each monkey why it was  beating up the new monkey, each probably would say, “I don’t know, that  is just the way we do things around here.”</p></blockquote>
