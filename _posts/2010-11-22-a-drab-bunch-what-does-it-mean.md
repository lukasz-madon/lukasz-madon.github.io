<p>The quote from Pro in <a class="zem_slink" title="Windows Presentation Foundation" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">WPF</a> book:</p>
<p><em>"WPF applications would be a drab bunch if you were limited to the plain, gray look of ordinary buttons </em><em>and other common controls. "</em></p>
<p>My first thought was "what does it mean?". I've checked the dictionary - no help, then I've tried to <a href="http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22drab+bunch%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=573da4ec7e15bdf2">google it</a> which also didn't give me the answer so I asked friend of mine form UK. He had no idea what it is. I was a little bit confused<em>, </em>whether it was a typo yet thanks to friend from U.S (Hi Gonzo) I have my answer.</p>
<p><strong>it's 1950s way to say boring or not happening, not cool group - beatnik stuff</strong></p>
<p>Book writers should bare in mind that majority od developers are not U.S. based,  shouldn't they?<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Some sophisticated content may not be understood.</p>
<p>whoa I got the e-mail from Matthew MacDonald himself.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Drab” means “lacking color  or liveliness” so the sentence “WPF applications would be a drab bunch  …” means “WPF applications would be a dull, boring bunch of applications  …” I assure you there’s no “beatnik” connection.</p>
<p>Perhaps the combination of clauses just made my sentence unnecessarily confusing?"</p></blockquote>
<p>puzzle solved :P<em><br />
</em></p>
