To store my passwords I use a hybrid approach with Lastpass used as a password entropy storage.
For important services, like Github, I only store half of the password in LastPass. Then I add a short random string and a generic short password. The final password is 12-16 random characters from LastPass + 3 chars that I generate from the service name (in my head) and a short 5 characters password.

If LastPass leaks the secrets no one is able to take over the accounts easily. For services that don't matter much I just store the whole password in LastPass.

It requires no extra work - Lastpass automatically fills out the creds. I have to type a few extra characters in password input and press login. Only tiny annoyance is pressing `No` in Lastpass "Do you want to update your password?" pop-up.
